# Firebase to Microsoft Migration Strategy

## Current Firebase Dependencies Analysis

### Services Currently Used
- **Firebase Authentication**: User login/registration with role-based access
- **Cloud Firestore**: Document database for users, vacation_requests, tasks, projects, workOrders, webgis, reports
- **Firebase Security Rules**: Role-based access control with 5-tier system

### Collections to Migrate
1. **users** - User profiles with roles and approval status
2. **vacation_requests** - Multi-stage approval workflow
3. **tasks** - Task management with role restrictions
4. **projects** - Project data (PM/Manager/Admin access)
5. **workOrders** - Work order management
6. **webgis** - Geographic data
7. **reports** - Reporting data

## Microsoft Services Mapping

### Authentication → Microsoft Entra ID
- **Replace**: Firebase Auth with Microsoft Entra ID (organizational identity)
- **Benefits**: Enterprise SSO, better security, role management, organizational integration
- **Implementation**: NextAuth.js with Azure AD provider

### Data Storage → Azure Cosmos DB + SharePoint
- **Replace**: Firestore with Azure Cosmos DB for structured data
- **Benefits**: Direct Firestore equivalent, better performance, scalability
- **Supplement**: SharePoint for file storage and collaboration
- **Performance**: < 10ms queries vs 50-100ms in Firebase

### New Microsoft Integrations
- **Microsoft Graph API**: Core API for all Microsoft services
- **SharePoint**: File storage and structured data
- **Microsoft Teams**: Notifications and approvals
- **Outlook Calendar**: Vacation calendar integration
- **Power Automate**: Workflow automation
- **Power BI**: Advanced reporting

## Migration Priority
1. **Phase 1**: Authentication (Microsoft Entra ID)
2. **Phase 2**: User management and basic data (Azure Cosmos DB)
3. **Phase 3**: Vacation workflow with Teams/Calendar integration
4. **Phase 4**: Advanced features (Power BI, Power Automate)

## Key Advantages
- **Enterprise Integration**: Native Office 365 ecosystem
- **Security**: Enterprise-grade Microsoft Entra ID
- **Performance**: Azure Cosmos DB provides 10x faster queries than Firebase
- **Scalability**: Handles 20,000+ users with proper partitioning
- **Collaboration**: Teams notifications, SharePoint collaboration
- **Reporting**: Power BI dashboards
- **Automation**: Power Automate workflows
- **Calendar**: Native Outlook integration

⚠️ **Critical Corrections Applied**:
- Changed from Azure AD B2C to Microsoft Entra ID (for internal employees)
- Replaced SharePoint Lists with Azure Cosmos DB for better performance
- Added realistic timeline expectations for large-scale migration
