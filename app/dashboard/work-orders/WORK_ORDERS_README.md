## 🔄 How It Works

### Work Order Lifecycle
1. **Creation**: PM/Manager/Admin creates work order linked to existing project
2. **Assignment**: Team members are assigned with specific roles
3. **Execution**: Assigned users track time, add comments, upload files
4. **Monitoring**: Managers monitor progress through reports and individual views
5. **Completion**: Status updated to completed with final time/cost calculations

### User Roles & Permissions

| Role | Create | View All | Edit Status | Time Tracking | Comments | Attachments |
|------|--------|----------|-------------|---------------|----------|-------------|
| Admin | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Manager | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| PM | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Employee | ❌ | ✅* | ✅** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |

*Can view assigned work orders only
**Limited status transitions only

### Time Tracking Flow
```
User clicks "Start Work" 
    ↓
Session begins, timer starts
    ↓
User can pause/resume work
    ↓
User clicks "Stop Work"
    ↓
Session ends, duration calculated
    ↓
Total time updated automatically
```
